Current processing of Spectrum CSS turns `.spectrum-Link.focus-ring` into `a:focus-visible` and _then_
`.spectrum-Link--overBackground` into `:host([over-background]) a` inverting the specificty relationship.
Until we find a non-spot fix, this manual extension of the selector specificity will be required.
